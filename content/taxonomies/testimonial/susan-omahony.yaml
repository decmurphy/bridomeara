  We have had the pleasure of inviting Bríd O’Meara to conduct skills training sessions at University College Cork (UCC) over the past few years. Bríd’s extensive clinical mental health background combined with her experience developing and delivering national mental wellbeing programmes shines through in her excellent presentations.
  Her engaging speaking style makes complex mental health topics accessible and relatable, helping our staff and managers to recognise early warning signs and understand common mental health difficulties. Bríd provides practical tools, skills, and techniques for managing mental wellbeing, which are simple to integrate into daily life. Her ability to connect with the audience and deliver clear, actionable takeaways is always highly appreciated.
  Staff feedback is always overwhelmingly positive, with many noting how Bríd’s insights and practical advice have already made a significant impact on their approach to mental health and wellbeing. We are grateful for Bríd’s expertise and look forward to ongoing future collaborations.
  Thank you, Bríd, for your invaluable contribution to our mental health and wellbeing initiatives at UCC.
