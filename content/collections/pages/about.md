Bríd is an accredited member of the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (MIACP), an accredited EMDR practitioner, with a BA (Hons) in Integrative Counselling and Psychotherapy. She is also a registered psychiatric and general trained nurse (RPN, RGN), and has over four decades of experience working in mental health and wellbeing in Ireland.

Her philosophy of counselling is person-centred, humanistic/existential, believing that, as all people are individual, therapy is individual, too. She believes that people strive to grow towards light, to blossom, and are multidimensional creatures who are constantly interacting with the world around them. She has a specific interest in trauma.

Bríd has held senior nursing and management positions in leading mental health services including Director of Services with national mental health charity, Aware,  Director of Services in St. Joseph’s Centre for Dementia Care, Shankill and St. John of God Hospital Limited and Deputy Director of Nursing in St. John of God Psychiatric Hospital, Stillorgan, Dublin.

Additionally, Bríd holds a Masters Degree in Health Services Management (TCD) and a Higher Diploma in Healthcare Risk Management (UCD).

Bríd provides a suite of unique and comprehensive services drawing on her extensive professional development portfolio. She combines this with her experience in nursing, counselling and psychotherapy, health services management, project management, mental wellbeing programme development, services development, public speaking and media. She is an experienced conference speaker, both nationally and internationally.

With a special interest in the Recovery Framework, she is passionate about educating and empowering people to care for their own mental health, assisting in changing and normalising attitudes and beliefs about mental wellbeing. She constantly promotes self care for mental wellbeing and thrives on simplifying approaches to care, ensuring accessibility for all.
