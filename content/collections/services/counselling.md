  Are you looking for a counsellor/psychotherapist?

  People seek counselling for many different reasons. Some seek help to resolve issues from the past, some to manage current life issues, some to address stress, anxiety, low mood, burnout or other mental health issues.

People seek counselling for many different reasons. Some seek help to resolve issues from the past, some to manage current life issues, some to address stress, anxiety, low mood, burnout or other mental health issues.

I see people as multidimensional human beings, who are constantly interacting with the world around them. I place you and your life issues at the centre of your therapy experience, as we work together in a safe, caring and non-judgmental space

With an honours degree in integrative counselling and psychotherapy, I adopt a humanistic/existential approach, principally integrating person-centred therapy with choice theory/reality therapy and existentialism. Considering your individual needs as a client, I also integrate transactional analysis, polyvagal theory, mindfulness, self-compassion, EMDR and psychoeducation. Incorporating my extensive experience in mental health and wellbeing, I constantly promote personal empowerment.
