  Are you looking for a counsellor/psychotherapist?

  People seek counselling for many different reasons. Some seek help to resolve issues from the past, some to manage current life concerns, some to address stress, anxiety, low mood, burnout, trauma or other mental health issues.

People seek counselling for many different reasons. Some seek help to resolve issues from the past, some to manage current life concerns, some to address stress, anxiety, low mood, burnout, trauma or other mental health issues.

I see people as multidimensional human beings, who are constantly interacting with the world around them. I place you and your life issues at the centre of your therapy experience, as we work together in a safe, caring and non-judgmental space.

As an EMDR accredited practitioner, I have a specific interest in trauma. 
With an honours degree in integrative counselling and psychotherapy, I adopt a humanistic/existential approach, principally integrating person-centred therapy with choice theory/reality therapy and existentialism.

Considering your individual needs as a client, I also integrate EMDR, transactional analysis, polyvagal theory, mindfulness, self-compassion, and I place emphasis on psychoeducation. Incorporating my extensive experience in mental health and wellbeing, I constantly promote personal empowerment.
